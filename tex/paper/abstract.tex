The classical methods for $k$-means clustering can perform poorly in high dimensional feature spaces or in the presence of noise. This motivates the addition of an autoencoder architecture to simultaneously reduce the dimensionality of the data and remove noise. In this work, I provide a model which jointly trains a denoising autoencoder and optimizes the $k$-means objective. I see that my model is capable of producing higher quality clusterings than the standard algorithm.
